# Introduction

Welcome to the first session of **How do I configure my project**.  

When creating a project based on React, the important thing to note is that starting from **version 18**, React recommends using frameworks built on top of React for creating websites or web applications.  

Here, we will review two of the most important methods and step by step turn them into an ideal project.  

---

## 1. Next.js  

**Next.js** is a React framework whose biggest advantage is that it follows a standard and optimized structure.  

To create a Next.js project, open your terminal and run the following command:  

```bash
npx create-next-app@latest
```

```bash
√ What is your project named? ... nextjs-template
√ Would you like to use TypeScript? ... No / Yes
√ Which linter would you like to use? » ESLint
√ Would you like to use Tailwind CSS? ... No / Yes
√ Would you like your code inside a `src/` directory? ... No / Yes
√ Would you like to use App Router? (recommended) ... No / Yes
√ Would you like to use Turbopack? (recommended) ... No / Yes
√ Would you like to customize the import alias (`@/*` by default)? ... No / Yes
√ What import alias would you like configured? ... ~/*
```

## 2. React Router

**React Router** is a popular and well-known React library for application routing.
When combined with **Vite.js**, it becomes a powerful framework.

To create such a project, open your terminal and enter the following command:

```bash
npx create-react-router@latest
```

```bash
create-react-router v7.8.2
